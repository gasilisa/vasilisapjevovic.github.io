Sure! To create a two-column layout using Bootstrap, you need to include the Bootstrap CSS file in your HTML and then use Bootstrap's grid system to structure the columns. Here's how you can do it:

Including Bootstrap
First, include the Bootstrap CSS in the <head> section of your HTML file. You can use a CDN for this:

html
Copy code
<link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
HTML Structure
Then, modify your biography.html file to create the two-column layout.

biography.html
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
